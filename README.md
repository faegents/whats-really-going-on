# What's Really Going On

**A conspiracy theory party card game for 2–6 players.**

Players draw from three decks to assemble a unique conspiracy theory, then must present and defend it under hostile questioning. The most convincing theorist wins.

## Concept

> *"[THE ILLUMINATI] [faked the moon landing] [because the Simpsons predicted it in 1998, down to the exact date]."*

Three decks combine to form a complete conspiracy:
- **Deck A (Red) — THE ACTORS:** Who is behind it
- **Deck B (Black) — THE ACT:** What they did
- **Deck C (Green) — THE EVIDENCE:** Why/how we know (motive + proof)

Players then deliver a 3-minute presentation defending their theory, answer hostile questions from other players, and are judged by group vote.
