## The 10 Boost Types (3 copies each)

### 1. DOUBLE DOWN
> *They're not just in on it. There's a layer above them.*

The Theorist must claim the conspiracy goes deeper than initially presented. A second ACTOR is secretly controlling the first one. Name the second actor during Q&A and explain how they fit.

---

### 2. EXPERT WITNESS
> *The credentials are real. The institution is also real. Neither of them exist.*

During Q&A, the Theorist must cite at least one specific fake expert by:
- Full name
- Academic title
- Institution

Example: *"Dr. Margaux Pelletier, Senior Analyst at the Institute for Applied Cognitive Suppression, published a paper on exactly this in 2019."*

---

### 3. THE MEDIA COVERUP
> *Whose side are you on, exactly?*

Every single answer during Q&A must begin with the exact phrase: **"That's exactly what they want you to think."**

If the Theorist forgets even once, The Panel may immediately call it out and the Theorist loses the Boost Card bonus.

---

### 4. CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE
> *The proof exists. It's in this room. Right now.*

At some point during Q&A, the Theorist must stand up, point to a specific location in the room, and explain what evidence would be found there if The Panel had the clearance to access it.

---

### 5. TIMELINE SHIFT
> *You think this started recently. Adorable.*

The conspiracy must now have begun at least **200 years earlier** than originally implied. The Theorist must explain how the origins predate their initial claim and what was happening "back then."

---

### 6. ALLY REVEALED
> *One of you is not who they appear to be.*

Before Q&A begins, the Theorist secretly points to (or whispers to) one Panel member. That Panel member is secretly in on the conspiracy. They must corroborate at least one of the Theorist's answers during Q&A — without being asked to.

If the Ally provides a successful corroboration (Panel majority thumbs up), both the Theorist and the Ally earn the Boost Card bonus point.

---

### 7. IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU THINK
> *You only scratched the surface.*

Draw one additional card from **Deck B (THE ACT)**. This is a sub-conspiracy that is also happening simultaneously. The Theorist must incorporate it into their Q&A answers.

---

### 8. THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM
> *Look around you.*

At some point during Q&A, the Theorist must imply (not accuse directly) that one of the questioners is an operative, plant, or active agent of the conspiracy. They may not say who. Panel members may react however they wish — questions, denial, playing along.

---

### 9. THE ACCIDENTAL CONFESSION
> *You weren't supposed to say that. You definitely didn't say that.*

At some point during Q&A, the Theorist must "accidentally" reveal a piece of information that makes the conspiracy even more alarming — something they clearly weren't supposed to disclose — and then immediately attempt to walk it back.

Example: *"...and the second phase begins in March— I didn't say that. That's not a thing. Moving on."*

---

### 10. NOTHING TO SEE HERE
> *That question is classified. For your own safety.*

The Theorist may refuse to answer **exactly one question** during Q&A. They must do so calmly, with a specific explanation for why answering that question would be dangerous. They may not use this ability more than once.

Example: *"I'm going to have to stop you there. The last person who tried to answer that question publicly is no longer publicly anything. I'll take the next question."*

---

## THE LEAK Card (1 card)

> *Somewhere in this deck is something they slipped in. When you find it — use it.*

When drawn, the Theorist does the following **before Q&A begins:**

1. Write a note on a scrap of Theory Sheet paper
2. Secretly pass the note and this card to any Panel member of their choice
3. That Panel member must read the note aloud at some point during Q&A as if they just received a genuine tip from an anonymous source

The note content is entirely at the Theorist's discretion. It can help, complicate, or completely derail the proceedings.

*This card is shuffled into the Boost deck randomly and may not appear every game.*

## Design Notes

Boost cards are the primary replayability engine. They force Theorists out of comfortable patterns, create memorable moments, and prevent the game from feeling formulaic across multiple sessions.

The best Boost cards work in any theory context — they don't reference specific content, just mechanics and performance modes.

The Ally Revealed and They're In This Room cards generate the most table energy and tend to produce the game's best moments. Consider printing them on slightly different stock for tactile surprise.
