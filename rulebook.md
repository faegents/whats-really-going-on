# What's Really Going On
### A Conspiracy Theory Party Game for 3–10 Players
**Ages 16+ | 30–75 Minutes**

---

*"They don't want you to play this game."*

---

## The Setup

The world is run by shadowy forces. Everyone knows it. The question isn't *whether* a conspiracy exists — it's *which one* you've uncovered, and whether you can convince everyone else that yours is real.

In **What's Really Going On**, players draw from three decks to assemble a unique conspiracy theory, then present it to The Panel with total conviction. Survive hostile questioning, earn BELIEVER votes, and score points. The most persuasive theorist wins.

---

## Object of the Game

Craft a conspiracy theory from your drawn cards, deliver it like your freedom depends on it, and survive hostile questioning from The Panel. Earn **BELIEVER votes** to score points. **First player to reach the Conviction Target wins.**

---

## Conviction Target by Player Count

The target scales down as the table gets bigger. More players = more chaos per round = fewer rounds needed.

| Players | Conviction Target |
|---------|------------------|
| 3–4 | 15 pts |
| 5–6 | 12 pts |
| 7–8 | 10 pts |
| 9–10 | 8 pts |

---

## Setup

1. **Shuffle each of the three main decks separately.** Place them face-down in the center, labeled A, B, C.
2. **Shuffle the Conspiracy Boost deck** (including THE LEAK card) separately. Place it face-down.
3. **Give each player a Theory Sheet and a pen.**
4. **Determine the first Theorist** — whoever most recently said something in real life that sounded like a conspiracy theory. If disputed, youngest player goes first.
5. **Appoint a Timekeeper** — any non-Theorist player. They own the timers. This role rotates each turn.
6. Play proceeds clockwise.

---

## How to Play

Each turn belongs to one **Theorist**. All other players form **The Panel**.

---

### Phase 1 — DRAW

The Theorist draws:
- **2 cards** from Deck A (ACTORS)
- **2 cards** from Deck B (THE ACT)
- **2 cards** from Deck C (EVIDENCE)

Choose **exactly one card from each deck** to build your conspiracy. Discard unused cards **face-up** to a central area — they are now visible to everyone and stay there for the rest of the game.

> **Why face-up?** Discards become Shadow Evidence — open ammunition for the entire Panel throughout Interrogation. The discard pile grows all game. Everything left on that table is a potential weapon.

Your three chosen cards combine into one theory:

> **"[ACTOR] [ACT] [EVIDENCE]."**

**Examples:**
- *"The Illuminati faked the moon landing because the Simpsons predicted it in 1998, down to the exact date."*
- *"Lizard People created COVID-19 in a lab to harvest adrenochrome from the general public."*
- *"NASA built a secret base on the dark side of the Moon to prepare Earth for the alien disclosure event scheduled for 2027."*

---

### Phase 2 — PLAN (60 Seconds)

The Theorist has **60 seconds** to jot notes on their Theory Sheet. The timer is running. The Panel may talk among themselves but not to the Theorist.

**During PLAN, the Panel prepares.** Each Panel member secretly writes one question on their Theory Sheet — a question they intend to ask during Interrogation. This question is private until they choose to ask it. Panel members may ask additional spontaneous questions during Interrogation, but the written question commits them to at least one genuine attack.

**While writing their question, Panel members should also scan the discard pile.** Any face-up card from any round is fair game as Shadow Evidence during Interrogation (see Phase 4). No claiming required — just note what's on the table.

> This eliminates blank-mind freeze during Q&A and keeps all players actively engaged during the Theorist's prep time.

---

### Phase 3 — PRESENT (90 Seconds)

The Theorist stands (strongly encouraged) and delivers their conspiracy theory as if they genuinely believe it. The presentation must cover all three elements:

1. Name the **ACTOR** — who is behind it
2. State **THE ACT** — what they did
3. Explain the **EVIDENCE** — both the motive and the proof

Present as if speaking to a livestream audience that is skeptical but open-minded. Passion is required. Humor is permitted. Dead air is not.

**When time is called, wrap up within one sentence.** Going over time forfeits 1 point.

---

### Phase 4 — INTERROGATE (90 Seconds)

**Before questions begin**, the Theorist draws one **Conspiracy Boost Card**, reads it aloud, and the effect applies immediately for the duration of Q&A.

The Panel now questions the Theorist. Rules:

- Any Panel member may ask at any time — no hand-raising required.
- Each Panel member **must** ask their written question at some point during Interrogation (or lose their chance).
- Questions must genuinely attempt to poke holes or demand elaboration. Softball questions ("So... you really believe this?") are a waste of everyone's time and you should be embarrassed.
- The Theorist must answer every question. They may **not** say "I don't know." They must stay in character.
- The Theorist may ask for clarification once — this does not pause the timer.

**CITATION NEEDED:** Each Panel member may call "CITATION NEEDED" **once per Q&A** (not once per game — once per this Q&A). When called, the Theorist must name a specific source for their most recent claim. Fake sources are not only allowed, they are the point. *(e.g., "The Journal of Hidden Truths, Volume 4 — the redacted edition" or "I watched a two-hour documentary on this, I'll send you the link, they keep taking it down.")*

The calling Panel member alone decides if the answer was satisfying. If yes, the Theorist earns +1 Conviction Point.

**SHADOW EVIDENCE:** At any point during Interrogation, any Panel member may pick up a face-up card from the discard pile and present it to the Theorist:

> *"If [discarded card] was the real [ACTOR / ACT / EVIDENCE], how does your theory survive?"*

The Theorist must answer. Any Panel member may use any card from the discard pile — there is no claiming, no turns, no limit. Multiple Panel members may challenge with the same card in the same round. The entire discard pile, from all previous rounds, is shared ammunition.

No points are awarded for Shadow Evidence — it is a narrative weapon. It creates pressure, reveals cracks, and occasionally collapses a theory entirely. Let the drama inform your vote.

Return the card face-up to the discard pile after the challenge.

---

### Phase 5 — VOTE

All Panel members **simultaneously** reveal one of three vote tokens:

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **BELIEVER** | Convinced, or committed to the bit |
| **SKEPTIC** | Not buying it, but solid effort |
| **PLANT** | This person is clearly an operative. Theory collapsed. |

Reveal simultaneously. No discussion until after all tokens are showing. You cannot vote for yourself.

---

### Phase 6 — SCORE

**Theorist earns:**

| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Each BELIEVER vote | 2 pts |
| Each SKEPTIC vote | 1 pt |
| Each PLANT vote | 0 pts |
| Unanimous BELIEVER (all Panel members) | +3 bonus pts |
| Majority PLANT (more than half) | –1 pt (floor: 0) |
| CITATION NEEDED answered to Panel member's satisfaction | +1 pt each |
| Boost Card effect fully executed (Panel majority agree) | +1 pt |

**Panel earns:**

| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Voted PLANT and it was a majority PLANT result | +1 pt |
| Best Question Award (given by Theorist) | +1 pt |

> **The Best Question Award** is the Theorist's call, given immediately after scoring to whoever asked the most destabilizing question. The Theorist has nothing to gain from gaming this — be honest.

> **Why 2pts per BELIEVER instead of 3?** At large tables (9 Panel members), 3pts/BELIEVER made 20pts trivially achievable in one round. 2pts creates meaningful tension without requiring a grind.

---

### End of Turn

After scoring, pass the Theorist role clockwise. Discards from ACTORS, THE ACT, and EVIDENCE stay **face-up** in a central discard pile — visible to all players, available as Shadow Evidence in every future round.

---

## Winning

**First player to reach the Conviction Target wins** (see table above).

If multiple players cross the target in the same round, play one final tiebreaker round:
- All tied players draw fresh cards and present simultaneously (2-minute prep, 90-second presentation, 60-second Q&A — no Boost Card)
- All non-tied players cast one vote: BELIEVER or PLANT
- Most BELIEVERs wins
- Still tied? The player who gave the Best Question Award most times across the game wins — they clearly understand what good argument looks like
- Still tied? Accept that the truth has multiple valid interpretations and share the win

---

## The Conspiracy Boost Cards

Drawn at the start of each Interrogation phase. 30 total (3 copies of each). The Theorist reads it aloud and must execute it during their defense.

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **DOUBLE DOWN** | Claim the conspiracy goes even deeper — add a second ACTOR secretly controlling the first |
| **EXPERT WITNESS** | Must cite a specific fake expert by name, title, and institution during Q&A |
| **THE MEDIA COVERUP** | Every answer must begin with "That's exactly what they want you to think" |
| **CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE** | Must stand and physically point to where in the room the evidence would be hidden |
| **TIMELINE SHIFT** | Conspiracy must now have started 200 years earlier. Adjust accordingly. |
| **ALLY REVEALED** | Pick one Panel member — they are secretly in on it and must corroborate at least one answer |
| **IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU THINK** | Draw a second ACT card; incorporate it as a sub-conspiracy |
| **THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM** | Imply that one questioner is an operative. Questioners may react however they wish. |
| **THE ACCIDENTAL CONFESSION** | Must "accidentally" reveal something you weren't supposed to, then walk it back |
| **NOTHING TO SEE HERE** | May refuse to answer exactly one question — but must explain why it's dangerous to answer |

---

## THE LEAK Card

**One card. Shuffled into the Boost deck. The most chaotic element.**

When drawn, the Theorist **does not reveal** that they drew THE LEAK. They set it aside, then secretly write a note containing a "classified tip" about their own conspiracy — something that appears to corroborate their theory or expose a deeper layer. The note must be signed from "A Concerned Insider."

The Theorist secretly passes the note to any Panel member of their choice. That Panel member **must** read the note aloud during Interrogation as if they just received it — interrupting whatever is happening to do so. They must treat it as genuine. They may not reveal who passed it to them.

The Panel then votes as normal. The Theorist earns +2 bonus points if THE LEAK note caused at least one Panel member to switch to BELIEVER (honor system — Panel members admit if the note changed their vote).

---

## Wild Cards

Each main deck has **10 Wild cards** shuffled in:

**Deck A (ACTORS) Wilds:**
- **[YOUR CHOICE]:** Name any actor of your choosing; write it on the dry-erase surface
- **[COMBO]:** Draw a third Actor card — all three are in the conspiracy, in a hierarchy of your choosing
- **[INSIDER]:** Your actor is a whistleblower from inside the organization — they want to be caught

**Deck B (THE ACT) Wilds:**
- **[YOUR CHOICE]:** Name any act of your choosing; write it on the dry-erase surface
- **[ESCALATE]:** Your conspiracy is the single largest coordinated action in human history — you must describe its full operational scale
- **[ONGOING]:** This has been happening since before recorded history. Millennia of cover-up required.

**Deck C (EVIDENCE) Wilds:**
- **[YOUR CHOICE]:** Name any evidence of your choosing; write it on the dry-erase surface
- **[DOUBLE DOWN]:** Draw a second Evidence card — both apply; you must reconcile them
- **[PERSONAL WITNESS]:** You personally witnessed this; describe exactly what you saw, where, and why you're still alive to talk about it

---

## Scaling for Large Groups (7–10 Players)

At 7+ players, enforce these adjustments to keep energy high:

**Panel Chaos Rule:** At 8+ players, the Panel elects a **Chief Skeptic** before Interrogation begins. The Chief Skeptic gets the last question and may interrupt the Theorist once mid-answer with "That's not what the evidence shows." The Theorist must respond without losing composure.

**Simultaneous Planning:** At all player counts, PLAN phase is used by both the Theorist (writing notes) and the Panel (writing questions). This is non-negotiable at large tables — it's the only way to keep 9 people from going brain-dead for 60 seconds.

**Floor Rule:** At 9–10 players, the Theorist may veto one question per Q&A entirely — not deflect, veto. They say "That line of questioning has been classified" and move on. Panel may not follow up on that specific question. This prevents dogpiling at large tables while keeping the Theorist on their toes.

---

## Optional Rules

### Hot Take Mode (Speed Variant)
No planning phase. The Theorist has 30 seconds from their last drawn card to begin presenting. Presentation is 60 seconds. Q&A is 60 seconds. No written Panel questions — pure improvisation. Maximum chaos. Recommended for 5+ experienced players.

### Expert Mode
No Wild cards. You play what you're dealt. No substitutions, no customization. The cards decide your fate, as they always have.

### The Senate Hearing
One Panel member is designated **The Senator** for the round — they conduct all Q&A in formal congressional hearing language ("reclaiming my time," "the witness will answer the question," "I yield to my colleague"). Other Panel members may ask questions only by addressing The Senator first. Senator earns the Best Question Award automatically if they run a compelling hearing. Other Panel members may dispute this.

### Cinematic Universe Mode
After the third round, each Theorist must reference at least one prior round's theory as supporting evidence. All conspiracies exist in the same universe. They must be compatible. Good luck.

### The Deep State Ruling
If a player's theory accidentally makes complete factual sense (group consensus that it's plausible), all other players immediately give that player 2 Conviction Points. The group sits in uncomfortable silence for five seconds.

### Grand Unified Theory (6+ Players)
Once per game, any player may spend **3 Conviction Points** to call a GRAND UNIFIED THEORY round. That player draws 3 cards from each deck (choosing one per deck as normal) and must incorporate at least one card from the visible public discard pile into their theory. Prep time: 90 seconds. Presentation: 2 minutes. Q&A: 90 seconds. Scoring is doubled. If majority votes PLANT, the player loses their 3 spent points and 2 additional points (floor: 0).
