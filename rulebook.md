# What's Really Going On
### A Conspiracy Theory Party Game for 2–6 Players
**Ages 16+ | 45–90 Minutes**

---

*"They don't want you to play this game."*

---

## The Setup

The world is run by shadowy forces. Everyone knows it. The question isn't *whether* a conspiracy exists — it's *which one* you've uncovered, and whether you can convince everyone else that yours is real.

In **What's Really Going On**, players draw from three decks to assemble a unique conspiracy theory, then present it to The Panel with total conviction. Survive hostile questioning, earn BELIEVER votes, and score points. The most persuasive theorist wins.

## Object of the Game

Craft a conspiracy theory from your drawn cards, deliver it as if your life depends on it, and survive hostile questioning from The Panel. Earn **BELIEVER votes** to score points. First player to **20 Conviction Points** wins.

---

## Setup

1. **Shuffle each of the three main decks separately.** Place them face-down in the center labeled A, B, C.
2. **Shuffle the Conspiracy Boost deck** separately. Place it face-down.
3. **Give each player** a Theory Sheet and a pen.
4. **Determine the first Theorist** — whoever most recently said something in real life that sounded like a conspiracy theory. If disputed, youngest player goes first.
5. **Play proceeds clockwise.**

---

## How to Play

Each turn belongs to one **Theorist**. All other players are **The Panel**.

---

### Phase 1 — DRAW

The Theorist draws:
- **2 cards** from Deck A (ACTORS)
- **2 cards** from Deck B (THE ACT)
- **2 cards** from Deck C (EVIDENCE)

Choose **exactly one card from each deck** to build your conspiracy. Discard unused cards face-down (or face-up if using the optional Public Discard rule).

Your three chosen cards combine into one theory:

> **"[ACTOR] [ACT] [EVIDENCE]."**

**Examples:**
- *"The Illuminati faked the moon landing because the Simpsons predicted it in 1998, down to the exact date."*
- *"Lizard People created COVID-19 in a lab to harvest adrenochrome from the general public."*
- *"NASA built a secret base on the dark side of the Moon to prepare Earth for the alien disclosure event scheduled for 2027."*

---

### Phase 2 — PLAN (2 Minutes)

The Theorist has **2 minutes of silence** to prepare their presentation. Jot notes on your Theory Sheet. The Panel may talk quietly among themselves but not to the Theorist.

---

### Phase 3 — PRESENT (90 Seconds)

The Theorist stands (encouraged) and delivers their conspiracy theory as if they genuinely believe it. The presentation must include all three elements:

1. Name the **ACTOR** (who is behind it)
2. State **THE ACT** (what they did)
3. Explain the **EVIDENCE** — both the motive and the proof

Present as if speaking to a livestream audience that is skeptical but open-minded. Passion is required. Humor is permitted.

**When time is called, wrap up within one sentence.** Going over forfeits 1 point.

---

### Phase 4 — INTERROGATE (2 Minutes)

The Panel questions the Theorist. Rules:
- Any Panel member may ask a question at any time — no hand-raising required
- Questions must genuinely attempt to poke holes or demand elaboration (no softballs)
- The Theorist must answer every question. They may **not** say "I don't know." They must stay in character.
- The Theorist may ask for clarification, but this uses up their time.

**At the START of Q&A**, the Theorist draws **one Conspiracy Boost Card** and reads it aloud. The effect applies immediately for the duration of Q&A.

**CITATION NEEDED:** Once per Q&A, a Panel member may call "CITATION NEEDED." The Theorist must name a specific source for their most recent claim. Fake sources are not only allowed — they're encouraged. *(e.g., "The Journal of Hidden Truths, Volume 4, the redacted edition.")* If The Panel (majority show of hands) agrees the Theorist answered it well, the Theorist earns +1 Conviction Point (max 2 per turn this way).

---

### Phase 5 — VOTE

All Panel members **simultaneously** reveal one of three vote tokens:

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **BELIEVER** | Convinced, or convinced enough to act convinced |
| **SKEPTIC** | Not buying it, but solid effort |
| **PLANT** | This person is clearly a government operative. Theory fell apart. |

No discussion until after tokens are revealed. You cannot vote for yourself.

---

### Phase 6 — SCORE

**Theorist earns:**

| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Each BELIEVER vote | 3 pts |
| Each SKEPTIC vote | 1 pt |
| Each PLANT vote | 0 pts |
| Unanimous BELIEVER | +2 bonus pts |
| Majority PLANT (charisma tax) | -1 pt (floor: 0) |
| CITATION NEEDED answered well (each, max 2) | +1 pt |
| Boost Card effect fully executed (Panel majority) | +1 pt |

**Panel earns:**

| Result | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Voted PLANT and majority also voted PLANT | +1 pt |
| First to vote BELIEVER and Theorist wins the round | +1 pt |
| Best Question Award (nominated by Theorist) | +1 pt |

> The **Best Question Award** is given by the Theorist after scoring to the Panel member who asked the most destabilizing question. The Theorist has nothing to gain by gaming this, so be honest.

---

### End of Turn

After scoring: pass the Theorist role clockwise. Discards stay face-down unless using Public Discard variant.

---

## Winning

**First player to 20 Conviction Points wins.**

If multiple players cross 20 in the same round, play one final tiebreaker: all tied players present simultaneously with a single fresh draw, and each non-tied player casts one BELIEVER or PLANT vote. Most BELIEVERs wins. Still tied? The player with the most successful CITATION NEEDED responses across the game wins. Still tied? Flip a coin and accept that some truths cannot be known.

---

## The Conspiracy Boost Cards

Drawn at the start of each Q&A phase. 30 total. The Theorist reads it aloud and must execute it during their defense.

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| **DOUBLE DOWN** | Claim the conspiracy goes even deeper — add a second ACTOR secretly controlling the first |
| **EXPERT WITNESS** | Must cite a specific fake expert by name, title, and institution during Q&A |
| **THE MEDIA COVERUP** | Every answer must begin with "That's exactly what they want you to think" |
| **CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE** | Must stand and physically point to where in the room the evidence would be hidden |
| **TIMELINE SHIFT** | Conspiracy must now have started 200 years earlier. Adjust accordingly. |
| **ALLY REVEALED** | Pick one Panel member — they are secretly in on it and must corroborate at least one answer |
| **IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU THINK** | Draw a second ACT card; incorporate it as a sub-conspiracy |
| **THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM** | Imply that one questioner is an operative. Questioners may react however they wish. |
| **THE ACCIDENTAL CONFESSION** | Must "accidentally" reveal something you weren't supposed to, then walk it back |
| **NOTHING TO SEE HERE** | May refuse to answer exactly one question — but must explain why it's dangerous to answer |

*(30 cards — 3 copies of each of the 10 types)*

---

## THE LEAK Card

**One card. Shuffled into the Boost deck. The most chaotic element.**

When drawn, the Theorist secretly passes it to any other player along with a written note. That player must read the note aloud as if it is a genuine tip they just received. The note's content is entirely written by the card holder.

---

## Wild Cards

Each deck has **10 Wild cards** shuffled in:
- **[YOUR CHOICE]:** Name any actor / act / evidence of your choosing, written on the dry-erase surface
- **[COMBO]:** Play two cards of that type — both apply
- **[ESCALATE] (Act only):** Your conspiracy is the biggest in history — describe full scale
- **[ONGOING] (Act only):** This has been happening since before recorded history
- **[DOUBLE DOWN] (Evidence only):** Play two evidence cards
- **[PERSONAL WITNESS] (Evidence only):** You personally witnessed it; describe what you saw
- **[INSIDER] (Actor only):** Your actor is a whistleblower from inside the organization

---

## Optional Rules

### Public Discard
One unused card from any deck is placed face-up when the Theorist finishes choosing. Gives The Panel a misleading clue about what wasn't used.

### The Deep State Ruling
If a player's theory accidentally makes factual sense (group consensus), all other players must give that player 2 Conviction Points in awe/horror.

### The Grand Unified Theory (5–6 Players)
Once per game, any player may spend 5 points to call a GRAND UNIFIED THEORY round. That player must incorporate cards from ALL players' recent discards. 3-minute prep, 2-minute presentation, 3-minute Q&A. Scoring doubled. Failure (majority PLANT) costs 5 + 2 points.

### Hot Take Mode (Speed Variant)
No planning phase. Choose cards in 30 seconds, present immediately (60 seconds), Q&A (90 seconds). Maximum chaos.

### The Senate Hearing
One player is THE SENATOR for the round — they conduct all Q&A in formal congressional hearing language ("reclaiming my time," etc.). Other Panel members observe only. Senator earns double Best Question bonus (+2).

### Expert Mode
No Wild cards. You play what you're dealt.

### Cinematic Universe Mode
Must reference at least one other player's theory from a previous round as supporting evidence.
