# What's Really Going On (WRGO) — Core Game Mechanics Ideas List

## 1. Setup
- Separate deck shuffling (A, B, C + Boost/LEAK)
- Theory Sheets + pen issued to each player
- First Theorist = most recent real-life conspiracy-talker (youngest wins disputes)
- Rotating Timekeeper assigned each turn

## 2. Player Roles
- **Theorist** — draws, builds, presents, defends
- **The Panel** — question, challenge, vote, score
- **Timekeeper** — rotating Panel sub-role; owns the sand timers
- **Chief Skeptic** (8+ players) — elected by Panel; gets final Q&A question; may interrupt mid-answer once

## 3. Turn Structure (6 Phases)
1. **DRAW** — 2 from each deck, choose 1 per deck; unchosen returned face-down to bottom
2. **PLAN (60s)** — Theorist notes; Panel writes 1 committed question each + agrees on Shadow Evidence card to deploy; optional Pre-Trial Wager written
3. **PRESENT (90s)** — Stand, deliver, cover ACTOR + ACT + EVIDENCE; no dead air; over time = -1 pt
4. **INTERROGATE (90s)** — Boost card drawn aloud; Panel fires all written questions; Theorist must answer everything; no "I don't know"
5. **VOTE** — Simultaneous token reveal: BELIEVER / SKEPTIC / PLANT; no self-voting
6. **SCORE** — Tally points; Theorist awards Best Question; role passes clockwise

## 4. Three-Deck Theory Construction
- **Deck A (Red) — ACTORS:** Who is behind it?
- **Deck B (Black) — THE ACT:** What did they do?
- **Deck C (Green) — EVIDENCE:** Why/how do we know?
- Mandatory sentence: *"[ACTOR] [ACT] [EVIDENCE]."*

## 5. Wild Cards
- Each main deck: 10 Wilds (rulebook) / 4 Wilds (PnP)
- Types per deck: [YOUR CHOICE] x2, plus deck-specific Wilds ([COMBO], [INSIDER]; [ESCALATE], [ONGOING]; [DOUBLE DOWN], [PERSONAL WITNESS])

## 6. Shadow Evidence System
- Previous round's 3 chosen cards remain face-up as Shadow Evidence
- Panel deploys one as a challenge during Interrogation — pure narrative weapon, no direct point award
- **SEIZED (v2.1):** First Panel member to call "SEIZED" during PLAN claims a discarded card as a formal challenge weapon; seizer alone judges the Theorist's response (+1 pt to winner of the exchange)

## 7. Voting System
| Token | Meaning |
|---|---|
| BELIEVER | Convinced / committed to the bit |
| SKEPTIC | Not buying it, but solid effort |
| PLANT | Theory collapsed. Operative. |

## 8. Scoring System
**Theorist:** 2 pts/BELIEVER, 1 pt/SKEPTIC, 0/PLANT; +3 bonus for unanimous BELIEVER; -1 for majority PLANT; +1 per satisfied CITATION NEEDED; +1 for executed Boost Card; -1 over time; +2 for THE LEAK vote-change

**Panel:** +1 for correct PLANT majority call; +1 Best Question Award; +1 Pre-Trial Wager match; +1 SEIZED win; +1 ALLY REVEALED corroboration

## 9. Win Condition (Conviction Target)
| Players | Target |
|---|---|
| 3-4 | 15 pts |
| 5-6 | 12 pts |
| 7-8 | 10 pts |
| 9-10 | 8 pts |

First to target wins.

## 10. Special Interrogation Actions
- **CITATION NEEDED** — 1x/player/round; Theorist names a source; caller judges; +1 pt if satisfying
- **Best Question Award** — Theorist-given; most destabilizing question; +1 pt

## 11. Conspiracy Boost Cards (30 cards + THE LEAK)
DOUBLE DOWN, EXPERT WITNESS, THE MEDIA COVERUP, CLASSIFIED FOOTAGE, TIMELINE SHIFT, ALLY REVEALED, IT'S BIGGER THAN YOU THINK, THEY'RE IN THIS ROOM, THE ACCIDENTAL CONFESSION, NOTHING TO SEE HERE

## 12. THE LEAK Card
- Hidden from Panel; Theorist writes a secret "classified tip" note and passes it to a Panel member
- Recipient must read it aloud mid-Interrogation as genuine
- +2 pts if at least one Panel member switches to BELIEVER because of it (honor system)

## 13. Large-Group Scaling
- **Chief Skeptic (8+):** Last question + one mid-answer interrupt
- **Floor Rule (9-10):** Theorist may veto one full line of questioning per Q&A ("classified")

## 14. Tiebreaker Round
Simultaneous fresh draws -> 2-min prep -> 90s present -> 60s Q&A (no Boost) -> non-tied players vote BELIEVER or PLANT -> most BELIEVERs wins -> fallback: most Best Question Awards given -> final fallback: shared win

## 15. Optional Variants
- **Hot Take Mode** — No PLAN phase; 30s to start; 60s present; 60s Q&A; pure chaos
- **Expert Mode** — No Wild cards; play what you draw
- **The Senate Hearing** — Designated Senator conducts all Q&A in congressional hearing language
- **Cinematic Universe Mode** — From round 3, must reference a prior theory as supporting evidence
- **The Deep State Ruling** — Theory that accidentally makes factual sense earns +2 from every other player
- **Grand Unified Theory (6+)** — Spend 3 pts; draw 3 per deck; must incorporate a Shadow Evidence card; scoring doubled; PLANT majority = lose 5 pts

## 16. Components
Sand timers (60s, 90s), BELIEVER/SKEPTIC/PLANT tokens (10 player colors), Theory Sheet notepads, dry-erase surfaces + markers, color-coded decks (Red/Black/Green/Purple)

## 17. Design Principles
Simultaneous engagement, forced minimum interaction, race-to-target win condition, floor rule on negative scoring, face-up discards by default, card cycling (all cards return to bottom)

## 18. Expansion Concepts
Historical, Sci-Fi, Local Politics, Celebrity, Corporate editions

## 19. New Mechanic Idea: Panelist Role Division

**Panelist Role Division:** Panelist team must divide up roles and ask the questions based on the selected role or roles. Points are given by the different roles. Perhaps different point values are assigned randomly to each role every round to provide the Believer some strategy around their argument.
